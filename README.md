# gtk2wine

simple utility that converts kde gtk theme to a .reg file for use with theming wine to fit in with other applications

its not perfect, but it works pretty well  
to apply the output.reg file to wine, you simply run this: `wine regedit output.reg` in the current directory  
if it doesn't work with output.reg, that's wine's fault just keep trying
